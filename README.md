* Communication protocols.
* Digital processing architectures, like FPGA.
* EMI
* Signal digital processing, modulation and codification.
* Embedded systems design.

Zruput is a space for professionals, researchers, entrepreneurs and students who are interested in  these topics:

* Software Defined Radio
* Satellite Communications
* Mesh networks
* IoT
* Electromagnetic Spectrum Ecosystem
* Amateur Radio
* Optical Communications
* Cognitive Radio
* RF & Antennas
* Fiber optics
* Signal classification
* Digital Broadcasting
* Modulation and Codification Schemes
* SETI
